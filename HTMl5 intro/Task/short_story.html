        <b>The Whispering Lantern</b>

<p> Late one autumn evening, Lily wandered into the old forest behind her
     grandmother's house. The trees creaked in the wind, and the air smelled
      like earth and memories. At the heart of the woods, she found a glowing
       <u>lantern</u> swinging gently from an oak branch. <i>Why is this here?
         Who lit it?</i> she wondered. <br> She reached for it, feeling both
          fear and excitement. The moment her fingers touched the cool metal,
           a soft voice whispered her name. <i>It knows meâ€¦</i> she thought,
            both terrified and amazed. </p>
