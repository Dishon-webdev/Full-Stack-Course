        <h1>A Little About Myself</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am <b>Dishon.</b><br>I am a student who enjoys learning and exploring new
             things and spending time doing what i love.<br> I enjoy spending time with my 
             family and friends, but I also value quiet moments where I can reflect and
              recharge.<br> In my free time, I have a few hobbies that I truly enjoy.<br> I like
               <u>reading</u> because it helps me learn new things and escape into different
                worlds.<br> I also enjoy <u>listening to music</u>, which helps me relax and lifts
                 my mood.<br> Sometimes I like to <u>go for walks or spend time outdoors,</u>
                  especially when I need to clear my mind.<br> Another hobby of mine is
                   <ins>drawing,</ins> as it allows me to express my creativity in a peaceful way.<br>
                    I believe that everyone should have something they love doing—it 
                    keeps life interesting and helps us grow.<br> One quote that inspires
                     me is: <em>“Do not wait for the perfect moment, take the moment and
                      make it perfect.”</em> This reminds me to stay present, do my best
                       in every situation, and make the most out of life.<br> Overall,
                        I try to be someone who brings a calm, positive, and honest
                         energy to everything I do.</p>
