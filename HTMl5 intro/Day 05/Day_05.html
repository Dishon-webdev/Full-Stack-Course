        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is a simple paragraph demonstrating how you can style HTML using CSS.
             Depending on your project, you can apply styles inline, internally,
              or externally to achieve different effects and levels of maintainability.</p>
              <br>

              <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
              <p2>Inline styles are added directly to HTML elements. They’re quick 
                for testing or small changes but can become messy in large projects.</p2>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
                <p2>Internal styles are written within a <b>"style"</b> tag inside
                 the HTML document's <b>"head"</b>. They are useful for single-page
                     websites or when styles don’t need to be reused across 
                     multiple pages.</p2>

                <h3>External CSS</h3>
                <p2>External stylesheets keep your design separate from content,
                     making your code cleaner and easier to maintain across
                      multiple pages.</p2>
