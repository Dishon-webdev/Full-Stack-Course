        <p>A paragraph is a fundamental unit of writing, typically 
            composed of multiple sentences focused on a single, unified topic.
             Effective paragraphs exhibit coherence, ensuring that ideas flow logically
              and are easily <u>understood</u> by the reader. The topic sentence often introduces
               the main idea, while supporting sentences provide evidence, examples,
                or explanations to develop the central theme. Paragraphs are essential
                for <b>organizing</b> thoughts and conveying complex information in a clear and
                 structured manner. The length and structure of a paragraph can vary
                  depending <i>on the topic</i> and the intended audience, but the core 
                  principles of unity and coherence remain crucial for effective
                   communication.</p>
